Apple Silicon vs. Intel Core chips: Apple Silicon processors, such as the M1 and M2 chips, are built on ARM architecture, a different foundation than Intel's x86 architecture. Apple Silicon represents a significant shift in Apple's strategy as it transitioned from Intel to their own custom silicon starting in 2020 with the introduction of the M1 chip. The move was driven by the need for better performance per watt, tighter integration with software, and more control over the hardware roadmap. On the other hand, Intel Core chips are based on x86 architecture. Both processors show distinct performance on computers, with Apple Silicon offering efficiency and performance per watt advantages.
